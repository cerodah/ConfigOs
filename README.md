# ConfigOs
My bspwm window manager configuration is designed to make ctf's faster, more comfortable and with functions performed in ctf's (based on s4vitar settings)
The functions can be seen in the shell configuration file ".zshrc".

In the bottom left. There is the symbolic hackthebox icon. It is configured so that when we connect to the VPN tun0 interface, it will display the IP of said VPN. In order to save time and not keep putting "ifconfig | grep tun0". In this case I have the OffensiveSecurity VPN connected, because I was doing labs before
